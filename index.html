<! JavaScript can be in the head section or body section >

<! Best practice is to put the script element at the end of the body section after
all the existing elements.
    reason 1: The browser becomes slower to render the script if it's in head
    reason 2: Almost all the time the script needs to communication with other elements in 
    the body.
